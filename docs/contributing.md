# Contributing
As said earlier, all we are welcome to all contributions for this project. All the source code is on GitHub at [https://github.com/WeAreDevs/robotic-scout-magic](https://github.com/WeAreDevs/robotic-scout-magic). Feel free to open pull requests and issues!

## Reasons Why and How You Might Contribute
1. **Documentation**: Either we made a mistake, or you know something we don't. Create a pull request to the `master` branch of the repository, or create an issue explaining the issue.
2. **Bugs and Glitches**: We aren't perfect. If you spot a sneaky bug, open a GitHub issue on the repository page explaining the problem. We will try to fix the problem as soon as possible.
3. **Creating New Forms**: We won't let user made forms be in the repository, although if we haven't made a form for this year's game yet, you can feel free to open a pull request to the `master` branch. If you want to add a form and you think it feels as if other teams can use it, open an issue with your idea, or create a pull request with your changes.
4. **Creating New Form Fields**: You can also contibute new form fields that you make. Make a pull request to the `master` branch.

## The Recommended Process of Contributing
1. Before you do anything, **we recommend opening a GitHub issue**, and we will tell you either if your change is a good idea, or it is not, before you make your changes to save you time.
2. **Make your changes.** Once you go the go-ahead, make your changes, and if you have any questions add a reply to your issue and ~~we~~ someone will try to help.
3. Open a pull request to the `master` branch of the repository. Depending on the changes that you make, will will either merge the changes, or request changes before we merge.
